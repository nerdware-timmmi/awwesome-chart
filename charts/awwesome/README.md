# awwesome

This repository contains a Helm chart to run [awweso.me](https://awweso.me) on Kubernetes.

Awwesome is a better ui for the [Awesome Selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) list.

> The initial startup, executed by an initContainer, takes some time: approximately 6 minutes. Please, be patient!

### generator

The generator is needed to supply the awwesome site with values once. These values are retrieved through the GraphQL interface of Github, and therefore, a secret with a Github token must already exist in the target namespace.

> You will need a personal access token from Github to be able to use the GraphQL API. More information on this can be found under "Managing your personal access tokens".

> It is recommended to use a fine-grained personal access token without any access rights. This is possible because fine-grained personal access have access to public repos per default.

[Source](https://github.com/mkitzmann/awwesome?tab=readme-ov-file#personal-access-token)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  github_token: <token base64encoded>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: awwesome
type: Opaque
```

The following values are applied to the `cronjob`, which runs repeatedly, and to the `initContainer`, which is executed once at the start of the `deployment` of the **web** workload.

| value                      | default            | description                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| generator.label            | empty object       | Specify what to override the workload names with.                                    |
| generator.schedule         | 0 _/12 _ \* \*     | twice a day, look at [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to get valid cron examples |
| generator.image.repository | mkitzmann/awwesome | Define which Docker repository the generator can be found in.                        |
| generator.image.tag        | 0.7.9              | Define which Docker tag of the generator should be used.                             |
| generator.secret.name      | awwesome           | Name of the secret containing the GitHub token.                                      |
| generator.secret.key       | github_token           | Name of the key that has the token as its value.                                     |
| generator.resources        | empty object       | At this point, the resources of the generator can be defined.                        |
| generator.nodeSelector     | empty object       | At this point, the nodeselector of the generator can be defined.                     |
| generator.affinity         | empty object       | At this point, the affinity of the generator can be defined.                         |
| generator.tolerations      | empty object       | At this point, the tolerations of the generator can be defined.                      |
